           <p style="text-align:justify">We are required to develop a system to take online exams. 
                   An online exam system is a computer-based test system that can be 
                   used to conduct computer based tests online. This examination system uses fewer 
                   resources and reduces the need for question papers and answer scripts, exam room
                   scheduling, arranging invigilators, coordinating with examiners, and more. The 
                   output of this process is a description of the computer-based test. Online exam 
                   design is an early stage of the system design process.

           <h2 class="c2">2.1 Description Class Diagram:</h2>
           <p>In UML, class diagrams are one of six types of structural diagram. 
             Class diagrams are fundamental to the object modeling process and model the static structure of a system.
             Depending on the complexity of a system, you can use a single class diagram to model an entire system,
             or you can use several class diagrams to model the components of a system.
            </p><br>

             <p>Class diagrams are the blueprints of your system or subsystem.
                You can use class diagrams to model the objects that make up the system, to display the 
                relationships between the objects, and to describe what those objects do and the services that 
                they provide.
            </p><br>

            <p>Class diagrams are useful in many stages of system design. In the analysis stage, a class 
                diagram can help you to understand the requirements of your problem domain and to 
                 identify its components. In an object-oriented software project, the class diagrams 
                 that you create during the early stages of the project contain classes that often
                 translate into actual software classes and objects when you write code. Later, you can 
                 refine your earlier analysis and conceptual models into class diagrams that show the
                 specific parts of your system, user interfaces, logical implementations, and so on.
                 Your class diagrams then become a snapshot that describes exactly how your system
                 works, the relationships between system components at many levels, and how you plan
                to implement those components.
             </p><br>

             <p>You can use class diagrams to visualize, specify, and document structural features in your models.
                 For example, during the analysis and design phases of the development cycle,
                 you can create class diagrams to perform the following functions:
            </p><br>  
            <p>-Capture and define the structure of classes and other classifiers.</p> 
            <p>-Define relationships between classes and classifiers.</p>
            <p>-Illustrate the structure of a model by using attributes, operations, and signals.</p>
            <p>-Show the common classifier roles and responsibilities that define the behavior of the system.</p>
            <p>-Show the implementation classes in a package.</p>
            <p>-Show the structure and behavior of one or more classes.</p>
            <p>-Show an inheritance hierarchy among classes and classifiers.</p>
            <p>-Show the workers and entities as business object models.</p><br>
            <p>During the implementation phase of a software development cycle, you can use class diagrams to
               convert your models into code and to convert your code into models.</p><br>
             
            <h2 class="c2">2.2 Description ER Diagram:</h2>  

            <p>ER Diagram stands for Entity Relationship Diagram, also known as ERD is a diagram that displays the 
                relationship of entity sets stored in a database. In other words, ER diagrams help to explain the 
                logical structure of databases. ER diagrams are created based on three basic concepts:
                entities, attributes and relationships.</p><br>
            <p>ER Diagrams contain different symbols that use rectangles to represent entities, ovals to define
                 attributes and diamond shapes to represent relationships.</p><br>
            <p>At first look, an ER diagram looks very similar to the flowchart. However, ER Diagram includes many
                 specialized symbols, and its meanings make this model unique.
                 The purpose of ER Diagram is to represent the entity framework infrastructure</p>

                    During the exam, the candidate will hear the question because the system will
